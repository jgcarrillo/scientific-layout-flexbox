# Types of scientific paper

The aim of this project is to practice with the Flexbox layout inspired by the image uploaded by [xkce](https://xkcd.com/2456/).

There are twelve types of layouts based on the image followed in the above link, that you can see below:

<p align="center" width="435">
    <img align="center" width="435" height="685" src="https://github.com/jgcarrillo/scientific-layout-flexbox/blob/main/assets/types_of_scientific_paper.png" />
</p>

## Basic explanation of CSS Flexbox

In order to understand the whole concept of CSS Flexbox, there is a sample image representing the structure of all the papers in this project.

<p align="center" width="399">
    <img align="center" width="399" height="387" src="https://github.com/jgcarrillo/scientific-layout-flexbox/blob/main/assets/info_layout.jpg" />
</p>

Every single project have been divided into different parts to achieve the image of a newspaper or a scientific paper and obviously to practice the concepts of Flexbox.

- **paper**
- **title**
- **info**
- **content**
- **content_left**
- **content_right**
- **number_page**
